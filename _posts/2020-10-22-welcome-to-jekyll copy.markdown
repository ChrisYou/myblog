I actually always believe that people more or less have kind of collectomania, or why are we so into "memorizing"? We crave the stones, draw the pictures, write the books and record the scenes and sounds, etc. Then we gather all these stuffs together! We are so addicted to it that we even squirrel the visible, intangible ones! <a href="https://archive.org">The Archive.org!</a> It is called the memory of the Internet. Here, I feel like I was in the old old past, where I keep shouting out "oh wow".
